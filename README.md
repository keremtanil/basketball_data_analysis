## üõ†Ô∏è Analysis Workflow

### 1. **Preparing the Dataset**
- Importing the dataset and required libraries.
- Initial examination of data structure, types, and basic statistics.

### 2. **Data Overview and Inspection**
- Inspecting data dimensions and variable distributions.
- Identifying the proportion of categorical and numerical variables.

### 3. **Basic Information**
- Displaying first few rows of the dataset.
- Summary statistics for numerical variables.
- Unique value counts for categorical variables.

### 4. **Missing Data Analysis**
- Quantifying missing values in the dataset.
- Evaluating the percentage of missing data for each variable.

### 5. **Visualizing Missing Data**
- Visualizing missing data patterns using heatmaps and bar charts.

### 6. **Handling Missing Data**
#### a) **Deleting Missing Data**
- Dropping rows or columns with excessive missing values based on thresholds.

#### b) **Filling Missing Data**
- **Numerical Data**: Imputing with mean, median, or using interpolation.
- **Categorical Data**: Imputing with mode or predicting values using other variables.

### 7. **Categorical Data Analysis**
- Analyzing frequency distributions of categorical variables.
- Exploring key statistics for grouped categories.

### 8. **Relationships Between Categorical and Numerical Data**
- Studying associations between team-based statistics and individual performance.
- Using statistical tests like ANOVA or visualizations to explore relationships.

### 9. **Visualization**
- **Bar Charts**: Frequency distributions of categorical variables.
- **Histograms**: Distribution of numerical variables (e.g., points scored).
- **Box Plots**: Comparing numerical data across categorical variables (e.g., rebounds by team).
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Relationships among numerical features.
